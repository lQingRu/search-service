# Elasticsearch query types

## TODO

1. List the different query types (might want to do this with (2) since dependent)
    1. `multi_match` query
    2. `combined_fields` query
2. List the different ways of querying to ES
    1. QueryDSL
    2. Native query
    3. EQL
    4. ...
3. List the pros, cons, use cases for each query type
    - This will be affected by our ES index design
