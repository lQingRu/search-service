# Search Service

# Introduction

- Search service has 2 main responsibilities:
    - Index changes from MongoDB to Elasticsearch (ES)
        - It contains an embedded debezium that listens to any changes to MongoDB, pre-process and
          then index into Elasticsearch
    - Perform search
        - Constructing of ES queries to retrieve results
        - Expose RESTful APIs to consumers for search

## Scope of Project

- This project here thus include the following exploration (in the order of priority):
    - Different possible ways to design ES index(es)
    - Data manipulation and data enrichment from MongoDB to ES
    - Different query constructions
    - Different designs for Search APIs
- This project takes into consideration, 2 types of search use cases:
    - Global search
    - Structured hierarchical search

## Context

- In this project, we consider the following scenario:
    - Person contains a device and a device can contain 1:M phone numbers (i.e. storing the past
      history of all the different phone numbers)
    - See `mongodomain` package for the specific fields in each of the entities

### Use Case: Global search

To do incremental evaluation, we consider the scenarios in order:

1. Parent and Searchable field scope

- M1: Denormalized
- M2: Parent-child

2. Parent and Searchable field scope with first-level context [WIP]

- E.g.: Searchable field as "Phone Number", with context from the "Phone Number" model
- M1: Denormalized
- M2: Parent-child (child being denormalized)
- M3: Grandparent-grandchild (grandparent: `person`, parent: `phone number`,
  child: `searchable field` )
- M4: Parent-child + 2nd query to get context
- M5: Denormalized (with all searchable fields in the same record) + Parent-child
    - To use `inner_hits`

3. Parent and Searchable field scope with second-level context [WIP]

- E.g.: Searchable field as "Phone Number", with context from "Device" and "Phone Number" models

# High-level comparison of general approaches for entity relationships

## Approach 1 - Application-side joins: Many-to-Many relationships

- Normalized indexes
- Very similar to `mongodomain`
    - `Person`
    - `Device`
    - `Phone Number`

### Pros

- Changes are centralized
- Well-bounded index
- Good index performance
- Higher similarity with mongoDB data model = Less complex transformation

### Cons

- Run extra queries to do application-side joins at search time
    - This could still possibly be cached for `Person` entity (which highly unlikely would change
      much)
- Search & Filters only possible in 1-level (i.e. scope of the index)
    - Not possible to "Search by person name & filter by device type"

### Conclusion

- Fully normalized is too restrictive and only for simple use cases

## Approach 2 - Denormalization: Many-to-Many relationships

- `Person`, `Device`, `Phone Number`
    - Person: Device : Phone Number

### Pros

- Best search performance
- Less complex queries for searching across enities that are linked (since it is within the same
  document)

### Cons

- Very big (potentially unbounded) index
- Changes to the entity, need to re-index all documents

### Conclusion

- Not very maintainable
- Could still adopt a partial denormalization that is dependent on the growth & frequency of changes
  to entities

## Approach 3 - Nested objects model: One-to-Many relationships

- This is used for multi-valued objects as well
- Each nested object is indexed as a separate Lucene document i.e. if we have `10` nested objects,
  there will be `11` documents created
    - Because of the expense associated with `nested` mappings, ES has settings that we can
      configure to guard against performance problems (but we will need to then have workaround):
        - `index.mapping.nested_fields.limit`: maximum number of distinct nested mappings in an
          index. Default = 50
        - `index.mapping.nested_objects.limit`: maximum number of nested JSON objects that a single
          document can contain across all nested types. Default = 10000
            - Limit prevents out of memory error when document contains too many nested objects
- To make changes to nested objects, would need to either:
    - Partial update API
    - Script
      update (https://iridakos.com/programming/2019/05/02/add-update-delete-elasticsearch-nested-objects)
        - Script update allows flexibility, but wary of maintainability and complexity

### Pros

- Fields within the object maintain their relationship
- Because of the way nested objects are indexed, joining the nested documents to the root document
  at query time is fast (as though it is a single document)
    - `nested` query and filter provide fast query-time joins
- Performant even with deeply nested objects

### Cons

- These nested documents are hidden, i.e. we cannot access/query them directly
    - Will need to use `nested query` or `nested filters`
    - Complex queries because a special nested query needs to be constructed for search,
      aggregation, and highlighting
- Results returned is the whole document
- Limited to a maximum of 10,000 nested objects per document

### Conclusion

- "Cross-referencing" nested documents is not feasible
    - Workaround is to use `include_in_root` that copies the properties from the nested documents
      into the roots, BUT brings up issues with inner objects (with no boundaries)
        - BUT this means that all fields in the nested objects are indexed twice
- Useful if there is one main entity with a limited number of closely related objects (nested
  objects)

## Approach 4 - Parent-Child model: One-to-Many relationships

- Similar in nature to the `nested objects model`, but parent and child are completely different
  documents
- Requires 2 additional "metadata":
    - Field with `join` data type
    - Extra details about relationship using `relations` object
- Parent ID needs to be specified when indexing child document because all documents inside a
  parent-child relationship must be in the same shard
    - Parent ID serves as a routing key

### Pros

- Indexing parents is no different from any other documents
    - Parents do not need to know about their children, can index separately
    - Hence fast indexing time
- Child documents can be changed without affecting the parent or other children
- Child documents can be returned as a result of a search request

### Cons

- Parent and all of its children must reside in the same shard and same index
    - Routing key needs to be provided when retrieval, deletion, update of child documents
- Queries are more expensive and memory-intensive (than nested equivalents)
    - Each `relation` level adds overhead in terms of processing and memory
    - Memory needed to keep the mapping of parent and children
- The more joins we have, the worse performance will be
    - Each generation of parents needs to have their string `_id` fields stored in memory, which
      consume a lot of RAM
        - Good to keep `_id` small
- Can be complex when querying across multiple levels of hierarchy or when there is a deeply nested
  parent-child relationships
- Only one `join` field mapping is allowed per index
- Cannot specify mappings for `parent` and `child` separately, can only specify the whole index
- Control over sorting and scoring is limited
    - Need to use `function_score` and sort by `_score` if we want to sort according to a field in
      child or parent documents
- **Can only filter on parent content or child content, BUT not both**

### Conclusion

- Useful if there are a lot more children than more parents and documents need to be added or
  changed frequently
- Useful if index performance is important
- Multiple levels of parent & child is possible BUT not recommended because of the overhead for
  creating joins for multiple layers
- A lot of uncertainties:
    - Is parent and children document treated the same when scoring if we use a default query to
      search across parent & children documents?
    - Are we able to set the number of documents to be returned for children documents?
    - Seems like unable to search against parent & children filters
        - Potentially a dealbreaker

# POC for Global Search

## Must-have features for evaluation

- Search
    - Base search
        - Simple string query without filters
    - Base search & static filter
        - Static filter here would then refer to category of search (could be a parent or child
          filter)
    - Base search & dynamic filters
        - Dynamic filter: Parent and/or Child
- Access control
    - Search
    - Facets
    - Sort
- Sort
    - First-level sort
        - Parent or child
- Pagination
    - Parent (total number of persons)
    - Child (total number of hits)
- Group by Person
- Highlighting
    - Parent
    - Child

## Devil's Advocate: Maintainability

- Search result not grouped by person?
    - What would be the chance of this?
- Update person's information
    - Transfer person to another team
    - Update field values
- Transfer device to another person

## Candidates

### 1. Denormalized

- Single flattened index: `denormalized`
- 1 Document : 1 Searchable Field

### 2. Partial denormalized

- Single grouped index: `partial-denormalized`
- Possible groupings:
    - Group by record
        - Aligns with ACL
        - Helps with growing size
        - Mitigation on data duplication
        - 1 Document: 1 Record : `x` Searchable Fields
    - Group by person
        - May be too hard to scale
        - No data duplication
        - 1 Document: 1 Person: `n` Records: `z` Searchable Fields

### 3. Parent-child model

- Single independent index: `parent-child`
    - Parent as a single document, Child as a single document

### 4. Normalized

- At least 2 indexes: `person` (container/parent), `all` (searchable fields)

## Summary

- Not accounting for access control here yet

## Plan

1. Data models
    1. Types of fields
        1. Object / Primitive
            1. Attachment (Long text with metadata)
            2. `<look through all types of fields>`
        2. Embedded object
        3. List of objects / primitive
        4. List of embedded objects
    2. Hierarchy
        1. 3 levels
2. Search results
    1. Hierarchy
        1. 3 levels (e.g.: Person Relationship & Communications)
    2. Which should always be the "container"
    3. Access Control
3. Search behaviours
    1. Hierarchy interaction
        1. E.g.: Search a 2nd-level document but filter by 1st and 2nd level fields
    2. Field behaviour (character filters, tokenizer, token filters)
        1. May need to go through the whole list of fields
        2. Access control
